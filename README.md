Project Title: Spam Email Classification Using LSTM

Description:Developed a deep learning model using LSTM to classify emails as spam or non-spam. Involved data cleaning, text preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.

Key Achievements:
- Preprocessed text data by removing stopwords and punctuation.
- Built and trained an LSTM model with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Implemented model optimization techniques for improved performance.
- Achieved over 95% accuracy in spam detection.

Tools: Python, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
